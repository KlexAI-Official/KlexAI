# KlexAI

**KlexAI** is a proprietary, closed-source multimodal AI model built entirely by a single independent developer. Despite limited resources and hardware, KlexAI delivers performance rivaling industry leaders like GPT-4o, Qwen 3, and DeepSeek R1 — a remarkable result of focused solo development and dedication.

## 🧠 Evolution of KlexAI

The development journey of KlexAI:

- **KlexAI Mini** (2.7B parameters): The starting point, built with a friend who briefly contributed in the early stages.
- **KlexAI Lite** (4.5B parameters): Fully developed solo — the first major leap in capability.
- **KlexAI** (59.7B parameters): The current flagship model, designed and implemented entirely alone.

> ⚠️ Note: KlexAI runs on extremely limited hardware — 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, and no GPU. It's a technical miracle that it operates at all under such constraints.
